## DESCRIPTION
This project is an outcome of a coding challenge that required me to showcase my skills in web design and development.
I appreciate the opportunity to work on this challenge and I'm excited to share the results with you. 

## CHALLNGE GUIDELINES
We would like you to improve the design of your chosen option. Please create your design in software of your choice, 
such as Figma or Canva. We’d like to see your new design as a PDF. Then, please can you take your design and build it in HTML and CSS. 
We’re not looking for any interactivity, just your static design created in HTML and CSS. We’re looking for clean, semantic HTML 
and easily maintainable CSS. Vanilla CSS is preferred. Please can you submit this as a zip file.Please can you accompany your
submission with an explanation of your design and details around why you chose to create it the way that you did. 
This could be annotations on the drawing, or a supporting document.
